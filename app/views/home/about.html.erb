                        <p>Numerous times throughout the year, the girls join their favourite staff members for Shabbos.
                            Girls are hosted by local families and get a taste of what we hope will be one Shabbos of
                            many! We host separate
                            Shabbatons are for all age groups, elementary students through teens. Our annual spring retreat
                            is an exclusive Shabbaton for 100 girls
                            held in a hotel location. We have also hosted smaller Shabbatons in communities, such as
                            Hamilton, to bring
                            the
                            Ashreinu spirit to girls who do not have the benefit of the Ashreinu experience. </p>
