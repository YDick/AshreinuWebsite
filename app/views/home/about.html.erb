    About Us
</h1>

<b>Ashreinu</b> is an organization that serves hundreds of children, teens, and their families each year. In the most amazing and unique display of Ahavas Yisroel, we connect every type of Jew. Ashreinu instills Jewish pride, love for Judaism, and Jewish continuity in all who are involved. Both our staff and families grow in their love and commitment to Judaism. 

<h2>Our Programs:</h2>

<h3>Overnight Camp</h3>
<p>The highlight of our year! A chance for our 100 girls to live Judaism. 100 girls of all different levels of Judaism live a joyfully Jewish summer. As our slogan goes: Ashreinu - Live it, experience it! 
Ashreinu prides itself for being the only Jewish outreach overnight camp in Canada.</p>

<h3>Day Camp</h3>
<p> In the heart of Toronto, 150 campers and staff enjoy a full summer of living joyful Judaism. Our campers spend the day engaged in fun activities where they can also learn about their Judaism. Kosher meals and snacks are provided. The bond the forge with staff members will last throughout the year! </p>

<h3>Shabbatonim</h3>
<p>Numerous times throughout the year, the girls join their favourite staff members for Shabbos. Girls are hosted by local families and get a taste of what we hope will be one Shabbos of many! We host separate Shabbatonim for all age groups, elementary students through teens. Our annual spring retreat is an exclusive Shabbaton for 100 girls held in a hotel location. We have also hosted smaller Shabbatonim in communities, such as Hamilton, to bring the Ashreinu spirit to girls who do not have the benefit of the Ashreinu experience. </p>
